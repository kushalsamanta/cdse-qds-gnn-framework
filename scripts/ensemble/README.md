This folder contains everything needed to launch the **20â€‘member ALIGNN

## Contents

| File / Dir | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **`submit_ensemble.py`** | Createsâ€¯`run_0 â€¦ run_19` folders, writes seedâ€‘specific configs, shuffles labels, generates `submit_job.sh`, then submits each job viaÂ `sbatch`. |
| **`submit_predict_ensemble.py`** | After all runs finish, loads every checkpoint and merges their predictions into a single CSV. |
| **`submit_predict_all_atoms_ensemble.py`** | Batchâ€‘predicts perâ€‘atom importance scores (Feature Nullification Analysis). |
| **`config_example.json`** | Base ALIGNN hyperâ€‘parameter file; `submit_ensemble.py` clones and inserts a uniqueÂ `random_seed`. |
